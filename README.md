## Recommendations Based on Data Analysis

### Sales Analysis
-  Keep promoting these through marketing and ensure they are always available.
- Sales and revenue dropped from April to June. Look into why this happenedâ€”maybe due to too many similar products, seasonal changes, or strong competition. Think about special promotions or discounts during this period to increase sales.

### Target Key Regions
- Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia are the top states for revenue. Focus marketing efforts and product offerings in these areas, strengthen relationships with key customers, and expand distribution.

### Enhance Product Mix
- The "Mix" category brings in the most revenue. Explore ways to expand this category or find out what makes it successful so similar strategies can be applied to other categories like Rural, Urban, and Youth.

### Broaden Manufacturer Partnerships
- Currently, only 13 manufacturers contribute to revenue. Consider partnering with more manufacturers to increase product variety and reduce reliance on a few suppliers.

### Seasonal Changes
- Since sales fluctuate with the seasons, prepare for slower months by launching special campaigns or new products to help maintain sales.

By implementing these strategies, the business can strengthen its successful areas, address declines, and explore new growth opportunities in various products and regions.
